# Micrograd Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice code for micrograd, a tiny scalar-based autograd engine with a small neural network library on top, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's tutorials. Micrograd is designed to be a minimalistic and educational tool for understanding the fundamentals of automatic differentiation and neural network implementation.
